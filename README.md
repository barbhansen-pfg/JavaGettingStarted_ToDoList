# JavaGettingStarted_ToDoList
Skeleton for Java for New Engineers to build a console-based ToDo list manager

# Week Four - Twelve Exercises
Fork and use the [JavaGettingStarted_ToDoList](https://github.com/gartee-john-PFG/JavaGettingStarted_ToDoList) repository as a starting point
Follow the instructions in the original JavaGettingStarted *ToDoProject.md* file.

## Write a console-based program
* Create a program in this project
    * this is a simple, console-based program
    * Build and manage a TODO list
## Requirements
### Create a ToDo.Task class that allows you to
* Display the ToDo.Task in a readable format
* Edit an existing ToDo.Task
* Tasks have the following characteristics
    * ToDo.Task Name
    * Due Date
    * In Progress
    * Completed
### Manage a collection of Tasks
* Display a list of Tasks
* Add a new ToDo.Task
* Edit an existing ToDo.Task
* Delete an existing ToDo.Task
* Read the list of Tasks from a local **tasks.json** file
* Write the list of Tasks to a local **tasks.json** file

### Create a console-based program that does the following
We're going to write a small, console-based program that allows us to manager our ToDo list.  it should allow us to read the file from **tasks.json**, save a changed set of Tasks back to **tasks.json**, list our tasks, add/change/delete a task, and exit the program.

The general flow of the program should be to display a list of actions the user can perform, accept a request, perform the request, and return to the original list of actions.

### Testing merge
### You can work with a pair, in a mob, or individually
### Create the classes you believe are necessary. It's good to discuss this with other people.
